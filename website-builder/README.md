# Website Builder: High-End Website Playbook

> This is the website playbook previously shared from `fischerls/high-end-website-playbook`. The specialist design and media skills it references are separate dependencies; this repository does not install them automatically. Ask the assistant to list what is available before choosing the build route. Use the bundled ADA audit for accessibility checks and mark unfinished manual checks explicitly.

How to prompt Claude to build a website that reads as $100k+, using a specific chain of design skills. Written 2026-08-25 after auditing `impeccable`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `emil-design-eng`, `scrollcraft`, `scroll-world`, and `brand-elements`.

## The governing fact

`impeccable` v4.1.1 states it outright: **"The brief wins"** and *"Redirecting a clear brief toward your taste is failure."* A vague prompt produces safe, measured, template design. Prompt *length* is not the lever. Prompt *specificity* is. Adjectives like "premium" and "high-end" are unfalsifiable and get ignored.

Three things separate a $100k site from a $3k site, none of which are prompt wording:

1. A committed visual world (one point of view, no hedging)
2. Real assets (custom photography, 3D, type) instead of stock plus Inter
3. Motion and finish craft, the invisible 5 percent

## Skill chain, in order

| Step | Skill | What it buys |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `brand-extract` or `brand-elements` | Real identity the site inherits. Skipping it guarantees generic. |
| 1 | `$impeccable init` | Writes PRODUCT.md so product truth is durable, not re-asked each session. |
| 2 | `$impeccable shape` into new-work | Locks the visual world. The step that actually decides quality. |
| 3 | `nanobanana` / Higgsfield / `img2threejs` | Asset generation. The real differentiator. |
| 4 | impeccable new-work + 21st MCP | Production build. |
| 5 | `scrollcraft` (only when scroll IS the story) | Forces 4+ device families, never the same device twice, bans the clay-diorama default. |
| 6 | `emil-design-eng` | Motion and micro-interaction pass, returns a Before/After table. |
| 7 | `$impeccable polish` + `bolder` + `delight` | Finish. |
| 8 | `ui-ux-pro-max --domain ux` + axe-core | WCAG 2.2 AA, non-negotiable. See [WCAG checklist](wcag-aa-checklist.md). |
| 9 | Ship | Deploy, verify the live URL, hand over the link. |

## The seven-slot prompt

Every empty slot is a slot the model fills with its default, and defaults are what make a site look templated.

```
$impeccable shape: new marketing site for {company}.

MODE: Persuade

1. WORLD (3-5 words + 3 refs from any medium, NOT websites)
2. POV: the one opinion this site has that competitors won't say
3. THE PEAK: one engineered moment worth screenshotting
4. ASSETS I own or will generate
5. TYPE COMMITMENT: {display} + {text}. No Inter, no system stack.
6. BANNED: what would make it look like every other site in this category
7. CONSTRAINTS: WCAG 2.2 AA, perf budget, stack

Do not split the difference. Commit to the world. Ship complete.
```

Reference slot 1 with films, album covers, shops, magazines, games. Naming websites is how a page ends up looking like an existing website, which is `scrollcraft`'s own warning.

## Standing banned list for slot 6

- Inter or the system font stack
- Purple-to-blue gradients and glassmorphism cards
- Three-icon feature grids on lucide icons
- Stock photos of people at laptops
- Emoji used as icons (`ui-ux-pro-max` flags this as an anti-pattern)
- The centered hero into three cards into testimonial slider into FAQ accordion into footer skeleton
- `transition: all 300ms`, which `emil-design-eng` bans by name
- Any section that behaves the same as the section before it

## The two force multipliers

**The peak (slot 3).** Award-winning sites have exactly one moment people screenshot. Naming it up front makes the build concentrate effort there instead of spreading it flat across every section.

**The banned list (slot 6).** Higher leverage than any positive instruction, because "premium" cannot be checked and "no gradient meshes" can.

## Escalation after v1

| Reads as | Run |
|---|---|
| Safe | `$impeccable bolder` |
| Loud or overstimulating | `$impeccable quieter` |
| Static | `$impeccable animate`, then `emil-design-eng` for the Before/After table |
| Generic | Go back to slot 1. That is a world problem, not a polish problem. Polishing a discarded look is the failure mode impeccable warns about. |
| Want the ceiling | `$impeccable overdrive` |

## First run: a landscape company in Gainesville, 2026-08-25

Ran the full chain unattended on a 45-page rebuild for a local landscape company. What the run taught:

- **The concept roll is the whole point.** Left alone the build would have shipped the dusk-patio "blue hour" site (candidate 1). The dice assigned candidate 3, the nursery plant tag, which turned out to solve the brand-orange contrast problem and gave every page a component the competitors cannot copy. Run `concept-seed.mjs` from the resolved real path of the impeccable skill's `scripts/` folder. A symlinked path prints nothing.
- `detect.mjs` silently degrades to regex unless `htmlparser2 css-select css-tree domutils` are installed in the skill directory. Install once, then trust it.
- Full-page Playwright screenshots do not fire lazy-loaded images below ~2 viewports. Scroll the page to the bottom in steps before capturing, or the review round "fixes" sections that were never broken.
- Unattended runs cannot hold the decision page. Write PRODUCT.md from what you know, label inferences, run the seed, build the assigned direction, and disclose the substitution in the first reply.
- Real client photography was the differentiator exactly as the playbook says. 99 photos at 2560px were sitting on the incumbent WordPress site, unused above the fold.
